### Web Development Assignment Build
---
Welcome to my README, just adding a few notes on some highs, lows, and interesting things I came across while building this site.

**Concept:** This page is a fusion of real and fiction for the concept as I find it easier to think about what to build if I have an established concept. In this case the location themed book exists and I wanted to experiment with how a website could support the theme of exploring an area.

**Content notes:**
- **Images** - All photography is my own work, and the two illustrations are from the open-source illustration site [unDraw](https://undraw.co/).
- **Fonts** - I have used Adobe Fonts and put together a typekit of specific fonts I wanted to use.
- **Text** - I have a weird mix of intentional words and Lorem that actually causes a warning during validation about the meta tag language, as this is an assignment build I stayed with the en choice.

**Other things of note:**
|<u>Topic               |<u>Comments  |
|---                    |---          |
|**HR usage**           |I'm sure the weird HR at the start of the HTML will be found so would like to explain... Due to the fixed nav bar at the top, when clicking the footer "Return to top" button it wouldn't return to 0 and would awkwardly crop of the heading. After trying many things I found placing an invisible HR meant I could ID it as the top so the return would go all the way up.|
|**Grid and Flexbox**   |I was really happy with the direction my page layouts were going before starting to work with Grid/Flex, so while I didn't do the full page layout with them they were essential for creating the sub layouts I wanted within the page.|
|**CSS syntax**         |I'm aware I have written some (probably a lot...) of things inefficiently/in long-form but being new to CSS I found writing them out in their long-form ways was really helpful for me to understand what stylings and settings I was looking at.|
|**Naming/BEM**         |Definitely need to get more familiar with BEM standards, but I think being aware of it helped me make better choices when naming things.|
|**Buttons and A tags** |Issue picked up during validation that button and a tags semantically don't work together, found theres is so many different ways to approach the fake "button link" idea. I think the method I ended up using (disguising the a tag) worked well in the end!|
|**W3 Validation**      |LOVE THIS TOOL, such a great thing to run everything through at the end and get some extra peace of mind!|

Really enjoyed this project and have been making many notes of more complex things I am excited to explore in the future.

Thanks for reading!
